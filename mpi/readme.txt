Part 2 â€“ MPI Implementation
Taking as a base the serial version provided, write an MPI implementation to
the optimal fence problem using the same input/output definitions than the
serial. Name this source code optimalfence-mpi.c.
The aim of this part is to be familiar with the different clauses provided by MPI
to exploit fully the API to get the maximum performance. Be particularly careful
with synchronization, communication cost and load balancing.
