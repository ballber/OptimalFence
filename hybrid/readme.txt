Part 3 â€“ Hybrid Implementation
Taking as a base your previous implementations and the feedback obtained
from classmates and teachers, write a hybrid MPI+OpenMP implementation to
the optimal fence problem using the same input/output definitions than the
serial. Name this source code optimalfence-hybrid.c.
The aim of this part is to become aware about the possibilities and limitations of
every paradigm and apply them correctly to develop parallel applications that
get efficiently the maximum performance. Be particularly careful with
synchronization, communication cost and load balancing.
