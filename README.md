# OptimalFence

Once upon a time, in a distant country, a king in his kingdom possessed a small and valuable collection of trees, which he inherited from the travels of his ancestors to other distant realms. To protect trees from thieves, the king ordered to build a fence around it. This task fell to the wizard of the kingdom, a wise man.

Unfortunately, the magician realized with deep regret that the only available materials to build the fence were wood from the trees themselves. In other words, it was necessary to cut some trees to build the fence around the remaining ones. Logically, in order to avoid the anger of the king and lose his job and his head in the effort, the magician wanted to minimize the value of the trees that should be cut. He retired to his tower and stayed there until he found the best possible solution to the problem. The fence was built and everyone lived happily.
